# expand-cell-fullscreen
Expand Jupyter notebook cell to entire screen

# Installation
1. Clone or download repo
2. Install extension using similiar: 
    ```jupyter nbextension install expand-cell-fullscreen --sys-prefix [--symlink]```
<br> You can use the option --symlink if you don't want Jupyter to copy the files to a Jupyter data path.  The option --sys-prefix will direct data and config files to be configured under the activated Python (useful for people using Anaconda and environments).
